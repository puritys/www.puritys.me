Sharing to multiple services is equally simple and effective: Day One (the app) lets you enable/disable external sharing services with one tap (a workflow similar to what Instagram has been doing for years), and posts shared to social services are embedded as links at the bottom of a published entry. Each social media post displays stats (views for dayone.me, retweet and fave counts for Twitter, etc) and you can tap on them at any time to view them on the service itself.
